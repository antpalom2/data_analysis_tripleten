# E-Commerce Funnel & Retention Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes user behavior from an e-commerce company's website by turning raw event logs into actionable business metrics. The goals were to:

- Construct a **conversion funnel** showing user progression from product view to purchase
- Conduct a **cohort analysis** to evaluate monthly retention patterns post-purchase

## Dataset

The data came from raw user activity logs (`raw_user_activity` tab) and includes:

- `user_id`: Unique user identifier
- `event_type`: Type of activity (view, cart, purchase)
- `category_code`, `brand`: Product and brand data
- `price`: Product price in USD
- `event_date`: Date of activity

## Key Analyses

### üîÅ Conversion Funnel

The `conversion_funnel` sheet shows how users moved from viewing products to making purchases.

- **Views ‚Üí Cart** conversion: ~29%
- **Cart ‚Üí Purchase** conversion: ~35.6%
- **Total funnel conversion** (View ‚Üí Purchase): ~10.3%

Conversion rates were calculated using unique user counts per funnel stage.

### üìÖ Cohort Analysis & Retention

Users were grouped into monthly **acquisition cohorts** based on their first purchase. The retention rates in the `retention_rates` sheet reflect how many users returned in subsequent months:

- Average 1-month retention across cohorts: ~5‚Äì12%
- Very low retention after 3 months across all cohorts

Cohort ages and purchase tracking were based on the difference between each user's event date and their first purchase date.
