# Appstore Intelligence – Shopify

This Power BI project analyzes public data scraped from the Shopify App Store to uncover what makes certain apps successful. By exploring app ratings, developer behavior, and review engagement, we identify patterns that contribute to higher user satisfaction and visibility.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To identify key factors in app success on Shopify by analyzing:

- Developer responsiveness to user feedback
- Review volume and its relationship to average rating
- Review helpfulness as a quality signal
- Total app exposure across the platform

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations & Insights

### 1. Most Helpful Developers
![Average Helpful Reviews](visualizations/average_of_helpful_reviews_by_developer.png)  
**Insight:**  
Developers like *Pictorem* and *Green Goddess* consistently receive reviews that are both high-rated and marked as helpful. This highlights their apps' strong user experience and community value.

---

### 2. Most Responsive Developers

**Insight:**  
Top developers like *FireApps* and *DSers* respond to thousands of reviews, showing active support. However, the most responsive developers don’t necessarily have the highest-rated apps.

---

### 3. Ratings and Developer Engagement
![Ratings by Replies](visualizations/average_of_rating_by_developer_answered.png)  
**Insight:**  
Ratings are slightly lower for apps where the developer responded, implying that developers typically respond to negative reviews — a signal of damage control efforts.

---

### 4. Review Activity Over Time

**Insight:**  
Initial review spikes suggest recent scraping or concentrated update cycles. Later patterns show a steady trend in new reviews, useful for modeling app momentum.

---

### 5. Rating Stability at Scale
![Rating vs Review Count](visualizations/average_of_rating_by_reviews_count.png)  
**Insight:**  
Apps with over 5,000 reviews tend to stabilize near a 5-star rating. Apps with fewer reviews show more variability, indicating inconsistent user experiences in early stages.

---

### 6. Most Visible Developers
![Total Ratings](visualizations/sum_of_rating_by_developer.png)  
**Insight:**  
*Elfsight*, *Ginee*, and *Omega* dominate in total ratings, suggesting broad market exposure. However, high visibility doesn’t guarantee review helpfulness or satisfaction.

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

This analysis uncovers key levers of app success on Shopify:

- Developers that engage with user feedback build trust but may do so in response to criticism
- Apps with high review counts tend to stabilize at higher ratings
- The most helpful reviews are tied to developers offering strong UX and value

These findings support data-driven decisions for developers, platform curators, and marketers aiming to optimize app store performance.
