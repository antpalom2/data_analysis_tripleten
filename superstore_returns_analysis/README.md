# 📦 Superstore Returns Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates the root causes of high return rates at a fictional Superstore. Using Tableau dashboards and story points, we analyze customer return behavior across products, locations, seasons, and customer segments. The objective is to present strategic insights that help reduce returns and improve profitability across departments and regions.

## 🔍 Objective

To help the CEO understand:
- What factors are driving product returns?
- Are there geographic or seasonal trends?
- Which customers or products are most return-prone?
- What actions can the business take based on the data?

By translating raw order and return data into interactive dashboards and compelling narratives, this project guides leadership in prioritizing cost-reduction strategies while maintaining customer satisfaction.
