# Superstore Returns Dashboard Analysis

This project was built as part of a junior analyst case study focused on return behavior at a fictional retail superstore. The goal was to identify what’s driving customer returns and recommend strategic solutions to minimize them — without compromising customer experience.

## 🔍 Objective

To help company leadership understand:
- What categories, customer types, or time periods are return-prone?
- Are there geographic patterns in return rates?
- How do returns affect profitability?
- What corrective actions are most promising?

This Tableau dashboard and multi-page story provides a breakdown of trends, customer behaviors, and KPIs to support executive decisions.
