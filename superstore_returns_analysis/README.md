# Superstore Returns Analysis

This project investigates the root causes of high return rates at a fictional Superstore. Using Tableau dashboards and story points, we analyze customer return behavior across products, locations, seasons, and customer segments. The objective is to present strategic insights that help reduce returns and improve profitability across departments and regions.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To help the CEO understand:
- What factors are driving product returns?
- Are there geographic or seasonal trends?
- Which customers or products are most return-prone?
- What actions can the business take based on the data?

By translating raw order and return data into interactive dashboards and compelling narratives, this project guides leadership in prioritizing cost-reduction strategies while maintaining customer satisfaction.

## 📊 Final Dashboard Overview

The executive dashboard offers a consolidated view of return rates across multiple dimensions: customer behavior, time of year, geography, and product category. Filters and tooltips allow users to drill into problematic areas and identify opportunities to intervene or course-correct.

## 📘 Key Visualizations & Insights

### 1. Monthly Return Rates
![Page 1](final_story_page_1.png)  
**Insight:** Returns spike in September and December, aligning with back-to-school and holiday seasons. These spikes suggest possible mismatches between expectations and product experience. Seasonal campaigns may need better expectation setting or flexible return policies.

---

### 2. State Return Rates
![Page 2](final_story_page_2.png)  
**Insight:** States on the West Coast and Northeast exhibit higher return rates. This suggests regional discrepancies either in customer service experience, delivery conditions, or regional product preferences. These insights can support geographically targeted interventions.

---

### 3. Return Rate by Category
![Page 3](final_story_page_3.png)  
**Insight:** Technology items show a slightly higher return rate compared to Furniture and Office Supplies. These returns may stem from post-purchase complexity, compatibility issues, or unmet expectations. This insight suggests a need for enhanced product information and customer support.

---

### 4. Return Rate vs. Profit Over Time
![Page 4](final_story_page_4.png)  
**Insight:** While return rates remain steady, profit margins increased significantly in 2021. This suggests improved operational efficiency, better sales strategies, or optimized pricing — despite the static return rates.

---

### 5. Sales vs. Returns Correlation
![Page 5](final_story_page_5.png)  
**Insight:** High-selling items (e.g., Binders, Accessories) also show higher return volumes. Although this relationship is partially expected, some subcategories like Phones manage high sales with low returns — ideal segments to expand or promote.

---

### 6. High-Return Customers
![Page 6](final_story_page_6.png)  
**Insight:** Certain customers exhibit return rates close to 100%, indicating possible abuse or dissatisfaction. Identifying and contacting these individuals could lead to better retention or prevent further margin loss.

**Insight:** These views synthesize dimensions like product type, location, and return frequency to allow dynamic filtering and drill-down analysis. Executives can interactively explore hypotheses and root causes using filters embedded in the story.

## ✅ Strategic Recommendations

- **Enhance product descriptions and post-sale support** for high-return items in Technology and Office Supplies.
- **Target geographic hot spots** with localized return policies, better shipping logistics, or region-specific inventory tuning.
- **Monitor high-return customers** and offer retention plans, educational onboarding, or direct feedback loops.
- **Align marketing strategy** with seasonal return patterns to reduce regret-based purchases during high-volume periods.
