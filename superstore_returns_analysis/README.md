# 📦 Superstore Returns Analysis

This project investigates the root causes of high return rates at a fictional Superstore. Using Tableau dashboards and story points, we analyze customer return behavior across products, locations, seasons, and customer segments. The objective is to present strategic insights that help reduce returns and improve profitability across departments and regions.

## 📚 Skills & Techniques Applied

As part of the **Storytelling with Data** sprint in the TripleTen BI program, this project emphasized visual narrative design and stakeholder communication using Tableau. Key skills applied include:

### 🧠 Data-Driven Storytelling
- Designed an end-to-end **Tableau story** across multiple dashboards  
- Used **dynamic filtering, color cues, and annotations** to build a clear narrative path  
- Framed insights around key business questions (who, what, where, when, why)

### 📈 Visualization Techniques
- Built **bar charts**, **maps**, **scatter plots**, and **line charts** to show temporal, geographic, and behavioral trends  
- Incorporated **highlight tables** and customer segmentation visuals  
- Presented multi-variable analysis (e.g., returns vs. profit) using dual-axis and quadrant logic

### 📊 Strategic Framing & Business Application
- Identified **seasonal and geographic return patterns** to guide operations  
- Segmented customers and product categories to expose **return hotspots**  
- Generated actionable insights with a focus on **cost reduction and customer satisfaction**

## 🔍 Objective

To help the CEO understand:
- What factors are driving product returns?
- Are there geographic or seasonal trends?
- Which customers or products are most return-prone?
- What actions can the business take based on the data?

By translating raw order and return data into interactive dashboards and compelling narratives, this project guides leadership in prioritizing cost-reduction strategies while maintaining customer satisfaction.

**Insight:** Returns increase in fall and winter months, particularly September and December, suggesting seasonal influences on returns.

### State Return Rates  
![State Return Rates](visualizations/state_return_rates.png)  
**Insight:** Higher return rates cluster around the West Coast and Northeast, signaling geographic patterns that may be linked to logistics or expectations.

### Return Rate by Category  
![Return Rate by Category](visualizations/average_return_rate_per_category.png)  
**Insight:** Technology has the highest average return rate, indicating potential post-purchase dissatisfaction or complexity.

### Return Rate vs. Profit  
![Return Rate vs. Profit](visualizations/rates_vs_profit.png)  
**Insight:** Profit increased over time despite a stable return rate, hinting at improved efficiency or pricing strategy.

### Sales vs. Returns Correlation  
![Sales vs. Returns Correlation](visualizations/correlation_between_sales_&_returns.png)  
**Insight:** Subcategories like Binders and Accessories show high sales and high returns, while Phones perform well with low returns — ideal for scaling.

### High-Return Customers
