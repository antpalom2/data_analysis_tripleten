# ðŸ“Š Superstore Profitability Analysis  

This project analyzes transaction data from a fictional superstore to uncover key business metrics around profitability, customer behavior, and regional trends.  

By exploring category-level and regional performance, the goal is to inform data-driven recommendations that help improve operational strategy, optimize product offerings, and focus on geographic areas with high potential for profitability.

## ðŸ“š Skills & Techniques Applied  
This project was completed as part of the **Data Visualization with Tableau** sprint in TripleTen's Business Intelligence Analyst program.  

### ðŸ“ˆ Visual Analytics  
- Built bar charts and scatter plots to highlight profitability trends across products and regions  
- Designed highlight tables to compare return rates and profit margins by category  
- Used geographic/state-level analysis to visualize seasonal performance  

### ðŸŽ¯ Dashboard Design Principles  
- Clean visual communication with consistent formatting and color use  
- Each chart focused on a specific business question  
- Structured insights around **actionable recommendations**  

### ðŸ”§ Data Structuring in Tableau  
- Created calculated fields (e.g., Return Rate, Avg Profit)  
- Applied filters for category, state, and customer segmentation  
- Aggregated sub-categories for summary-level insights

## ðŸ“Š Key Visualizations & Insights  

### 1. Profits & Losses by Region and Sub-Category  
![Profits & Losses](visualizations/profits_losses.png)  
**Insight:** Technology and Office Supplies are strong contributors to profit, while Furniture (especially Tables and Bookcases) shows consistent losses.  

---

### 2. Top 10 Most Profitable Products  
![Top Products](visualizations/top_products.png)  
**Insight:** A handful of products, such as the Canon imageCLASS, drive a disproportionate share of profits.  

---

### 3. Bottom 10 Products (Loss-Makers)  
![Bottom Products](visualizations/bottom_products.png)  
**Insight:** Certain products, such as the GBC DocuBind system, generate large losses and should be reevaluated.  

---

### 4. Average Profit vs. Return Rate (Sub-Category Level)  
![Avg Profit vs Return Rate](visualizations/avg_profit_vs_return.png)  
**Insight:** Products with both **low profit and high returns** are major liabilities; products like Copiers deliver strong profits despite returns.  

---

### 5. Customers with the Highest Return Rates  
![Returns by Customer](visualizations/returns_by_customer.png)  
**Insight:** A small group of customers consistently return nearly all purchases (90â€“100% return rates).  

---

### 6. Products with the Highest Return Rates  
![Returns by Product](visualizations/returns_by_product.png)  
**Insight:** Printers, phones, and furniture dominate the high-return list, pointing to potential vendor or quality issues.  

---

### 7. State & Seasonal Profitability Trends  
![State Seasonality](visualizations/state_seasonality.png)  
**Insight:** Profitability varies by state and season. Indiana, Vermont, and Washington perform strongly in specific months, suggesting opportunities for seasonal promotions.

## ðŸ§  Conclusion & Recommendations  

1. **Double Down on Winners** â€“ Invest in Technology and Office Supplies, especially high-margin products like Copiers and Canon ImageCLASS.  
2. **Cut or Fix Loss-Makers** â€“ Reevaluate Furniture (Tables, Bookcases) and products with persistent losses like the GBC DocuBind.  
3. **Manage Returns Proactively** â€“ Investigate chronic returners and strengthen policies on high-return product lines.  
4. **Leverage Regional & Seasonal Insights** â€“ Replicate success in strong-performing states and target peak months (e.g., September, December) with campaigns.
