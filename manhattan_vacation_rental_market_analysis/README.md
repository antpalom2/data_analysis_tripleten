## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps

Performed in Excel:
- Standardized `neighborhood` names using `TRIM()` and `PROPER()` → stored in `neighborhood_clean`
- Cleaned `bedrooms` column using `IF(ISBLANK(...), 0, ...)` → stored in `bedrooms_clean`
- Created a new `top_listing` column where:
  - `top_neighborhood` is `TRUE`
  - `top_bedroom` is `TRUE`
- Calculated revenue from calendar data using:
  - `IF(available = "f", adjusted_price, 0)` → `revenue_earned`
  - Used `SUMIF()` to match calendar revenue to listings
  - Estimated annual revenue = 30-day revenue × 12
